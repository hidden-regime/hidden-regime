Hidden Regime is a Python package for detecting and analyzing market regimes using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Built on a **pipeline architecture** that ensures temporal data isolation and rigorous backtesting, Hidden Regime provides three levels of abstraction:

1. **Simple Pipelines** - Quick regime detection with sensible defaults
2. **Financial Pipelines** - Comprehensive analysis with regime characterization and trading signals
3. **Market Event Studies** - High-level framework for analyzing regime behavior during market events (crashes, bubbles, sector rotations)

All analysis flows through a consistent pipeline: **Data → Observation → Model → Analysis → Report**, ensuring reproducibility and enabling rigorous verification & validation (V&V) for backtesting.

**FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.** _This is not financial advice and should not be considered as such._

## Quick Start

Hidden Regime provides three levels of abstraction - choose based on your needs:

### Level 1: Simple Regime Detection

Quick regime detection with sensible defaults:

```python
import hidden_regime as hr

# Create and run pipeline
pipeline = hr.create_simple_regime_pipeline('AAPL', n_states=3)
result = pipeline.update()
print(result)  # Shows current regime and confidence
```

### Level 2: Financial Analysis Pipeline

Comprehensive analysis with regime characterization and trading signals:

```python
import hidden_regime as hr

# Create financial analysis pipeline
pipeline = hr.create_financial_pipeline(
    ticker='SPY',
    n_states=3,
    start_date='2023-01-01',
    end_date='2024-01-01'
)

# Run analysis
result = pipeline.update()
print(result)  # Shows regime, confidence, returns, volatility, win rates, etc.
```

### Level 3: Market Event Study

Analyze regime behavior during market events (crashes, bubbles, etc.):

```python
import hidden_regime as hr

# Create market event study
study = hr.MarketEventStudy(
    ticker='QQQ',
    training_start='2018-01-01',
    training_end='2019-12-31',
    analysis_start='2020-01-01',
    analysis_end='2020-12-31',
    n_states=3,
    key_events={'2020-03-23': 'Market Bottom'},
    output_dir='output/covid_study'
)

# Run complete analysis
study.run(create_snapshots=True, create_animations=True)
study.print_summary()
study.export_results(format='csv')
```

## Core Concepts

### Market Regimes

Financial markets exhibit distinct behavioral phases:

| Regime | Characteristics | Typical Duration |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Bull** | Positive returns, moderate volatility | Weeks to months |
| **Bear** | Negative returns, high volatility | Days to weeks |
| **Sideways** | Near-zero returns, low volatility | Days to weeks |
| **Crisis** | Very negative returns, extreme volatility | Days |

Hidden Regime uses HMMs to automatically detect these regimes from price data.

### Pipeline Architecture

```
Data Loading → Observation Generation → Model Training → Analysis → Reporting
     ↓                  ↓                      ↓            ↓           ↓
  yfinance        Log Returns              HMM Fit     Regime Stats   Markdown
  Validation      Features              State Inference  Performance   Plots
```

Every analysis in Hidden Regime flows through this pipeline. Each component has a clear responsibility:

- **Data**: Loads and validates price data from yfinance with temporal isolation
- **Observation**: Transforms prices into statistical features (log returns by default)
- **Model**: Trains HMM using Baum-Welch and performs Viterbi inference for regime prediction
- **Analysis**: Characterizes regimes (returns, volatility, win rates, drawdowns, regime strength)
- **Report**: Exports results as markdown reports and visualizations

**You never need to manually chain these components** - the pipeline handles all data flow automatically.

### When to Use What

## MarketEventStudy Framework

The `MarketEventStudy` class provides a high-level API for analyzing regime behavior during market events. It encapsulates the entire workflow: data loading, model training, temporal analysis, visualization, and metrics computation.

### Basic Usage

```python
import hidden_regime as hr

study = hr.MarketEventStudy(
    ticker='QQQ',                    # Single ticker or list of tickers
    training_start='2018-01-01',     # Train on pre-event period
    training_end='2019-12-31',
    analysis_start='2020-01-01',     # Analyze event period
    analysis_end='2020-12-31',
    n_states=3,                      # Number of regime states
    key_events={                     # Optional: dates for snapshots
        '2020-02-19': 'Market Peak',
        '2020-03-23': 'Market Bottom'
    },
    output_dir='output/covid_study'
)

# Run complete analysis
study.run(
    create_snapshots=True,           # PNG snapshots at key dates
    create_animations=True,          # GIF showing regime evolution
    snapshot_window_days=90,         # Window size for snapshots
    animation_fps=5                  # Animation frame rate
)

# Print summary metrics
study.print_summary()

# Export results
study.export_results(format='csv')   # or 'json'
```

### Multi-Ticker Analysis

Compare regime behavior across multiple assets:

```python
study = hr.MarketEventStudy(
    ticker=['QQQ', 'CCL', 'XLE'],    # Compare tech, travel, energy
    training_start='2018-01-01',
    training_end='2019-12-31',
    analysis_start='2020-01-01',
    analysis_end='2020-12-31',
    n_states=3
)

study.run()

# Get metrics for specific ticker
qqq_metrics = study.get_metrics('QQQ')
print(f"Detection lag: {qqq_metrics['detection_lag_days']} days")
print(f"Crisis days: {qqq_metrics['crisis_days']}")
```

### What It Does

1. **Trains HMM** on pre-event period (isolates training from analysis)
2. **Steps through time** day-by-day during event period (temporal V&V isolation)
3. **Creates visualizations** at key event dates (e.g., market peak, bottom, recovery)
4. **Computes metrics** (detection lag, regime stability, crisis duration)
5. **Exports results** to CSV/JSON for further analysis

### Generated Outputs

- **Snapshots**: `{ticker}_snapshot_{date}.png` - Price + regime overlay at key dates
- **Animations**: `{ticker}_full_analysis.gif` - Full regime evolution over time
- **Metrics CSV**: `regime_history.csv` - Complete regime timeline with confidence scores
- **Console Summary**: Detection lag, regime durations, transition counts

See `examples/case_study_covid_2020.py` for a complete working example (135 lines).

## Configuration

Hidden Regime uses dataclass-based configuration for flexibility:

```python
from hidden_regime.config import HMMConfig, FinancialDataConfig

# Configure HMM
hmm_config = HMMConfig(
    n_states=3,
    max_iterations=100,
    tolerance=1e-6,
    initialization_method='kmeans',
    random_seed=42
)

# Configure data loading
data_config = FinancialDataConfig(
    ticker='AAPL',
    start_date='2023-01-01',
    end_date='2024-01-01',
    use_ohlc_average=True
)

# Create pipeline with custom configs
from hidden_regime.factories import pipeline_factory

pipeline = pipeline_factory.create_pipeline(
    data_config=data_config,
    model_config=hmm_config,
    # ... other configs
)
```

## Initialization Methods

Hidden Regime supports three approaches for initializing HMM parameters:

### 1. KMeans (Default - Recommended)

Data-driven clustering approach that automatically discovers regime structure:

```python
config = HMMConfig(
    n_states=3,
    initialization_method='kmeans',  # This is the default
)
```

**When to use:**
- ✓ Default choice for most applications
- ✓ No prior knowledge about regime characteristics
- ✓ Sufficient historical data (>200 observations)

### 2. Random (Quantile-Based)

Simple initialization using data quantiles:

```python
config = HMMConfig(
    n_states=3,
    initialization_method='random',
)
```

**When to use:**
- ✓ Fallback when sklearn not available
- ✓ Small datasets where KMeans struggles
- ✓ Quick prototyping

### 3. Custom (Expert-Specified)

Specify exact starting parameters based on domain knowledge:

```python
# Option 1: Direct specification
config = HMMConfig(
    n_states=3,
    initialization_method='custom',
    custom_emission_means=[-0.015, 0.0, 0.012],  # Bear, Sideways, Bull
    custom_emission_stds=[0.025, 0.015, 0.020],
    # Optional: custom_transition_matrix, custom_initial_probs
)

# Option 2: Convenience factory
config = HMMConfig.from_regime_specs([
    {'mean': -0.015, 'std': 0.025},  # Bear
    {'mean': 0.0, 'std': 0.015},     # Sideways
    {'mean': 0.012, 'std': 0.020},   # Bull
])
```

**When to use:**
- ✓ Transfer learning (use trained params from similar asset)
- ✓ Incorporating expert domain knowledge
- ✓ Research reproducibility
- ✓ Testing specific regime hypotheses

**Note:** Custom parameters are **starting values** - Baum-Welch training will update them based on actual data.

See `examples/initialization_methods_demo.py` for complete demonstrations including transfer learning workflows.

```python
import hidden_regime as hr

pipeline = hr.create_trading_pipeline('SPY', n_states=4, risk_adjustment=True)
result = pipeline.update()

# Access regime information
current_regime = result['regime_name'].iloc[-1]
confidence = result['confidence'].iloc[-1]
print(f"Current regime: {current_regime} ({confidence:.1%} confidence)")
```

### Research and Analysis

Analyze historical regime behavior with comprehensive indicators:

```python
import hidden_regime as hr

pipeline = hr.create_research_pipeline('BTC-USD', comprehensive_analysis=True)
result = pipeline.update()

# Result includes regime characterization, technical indicators, and performance metrics
```

### Temporal Backtesting

Test regime-based strategies with rigorous V&V isolation:

```python
import hidden_regime as hr

pipeline = hr.create_financial_pipeline('AAPL', n_states=3)
data = pipeline.data.get_all_data()

# Step through time day-by-day
controller = hr.create_temporal_controller(pipeline, data)
results = controller.step_through_time('2023-01-01', '2023-12-31')
```
