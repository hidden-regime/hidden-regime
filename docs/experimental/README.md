# Experimental Features

This directory contains documentation for **experimental and aspirational features** that are not yet part of the core Hidden Regime package.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**These features are NOT production-ready and should NOT be relied upon for production use.**

The documentation in this directory represents:
- **Experimental integrations** currently in development
- **Aspirational features** under consideration
- **Research prototypes** being evaluated
- **Historical exploration** of potential integrations

## QuantConnect Integration

The QuantConnect LEAN integration documents (QUANTCONNECT_PHASE*.md, API_REFERENCE.md, etc.) represent significant development work but are currently **experimental**.

**Status:**
- **Code Status**: Experimental/WIP
- **Test Coverage**: TBD
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive but not validated
- **Recommendation**: Do not use in production

If you're interested in QuantConnect integration, please:
1. Check the main README.md to see if this feature has been promoted to stable
2. Review open GitHub issues for current status
3. Contact maintainers if you want to contribute

## Using Experimental Features

**At your own risk!** These features may:
- Change significantly without notice

If you choose to experiment with these features:
1. Use in isolated test environments only
2. Report bugs and feedback via GitHub issues
3. Do NOT use for managing real capital
4. Expect breaking changes
